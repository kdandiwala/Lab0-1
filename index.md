### About Me

`System.out.println("Hello World!");` I'm a **Third-Year Computer Engineering major** studying at *UC San Diego*. I love listening to alternative/R&B music, playing recreational basketball, and being a big fan of the Golden State Warriors!

My favorite courses at UCSD so far have been (in order):
1. CSE 100 (Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms)
2. HUM 5 (Humanites Course - Modern Culture)
3. ECE 35 (Introduction to Analog Design)

### Experience
I've interned at [Nebulon Inc.](https://nebulon.com) as a software engineer and [Cogitativo Inc.](https://www.cogitativo.com) as a data engineer.
At Nebulon, I implemented error-logging wrappers and metrics on 100+ GoLang functions that queried databases in the cloud, tracking both the duration and total accumulated count of these queries. Check out a poster I made for my Nebulon internship [here](Screenshots/DANDIWALA.KRISH.2022.pdf).

At Cogitativo, I single-handedly developed an end-to-end ETL data pipeline project for 20+ sensitive medical datasets using AWS services such as Glue, S3, EC2, and Lambda.  

> "We found Krish extremely inquisitive and hard working. He was very much interested in learning the functions of our core division and also willing to put his best efforts and get into the depth of the subject to understand it better." -Dana Tom, Sr. Manager at Cogitativo Inc.

Some programming langauges that I'm proficient at include:
- Python
- Java
- C/C++
- Go

### CSE 110 (Software Engineering Principles)
My goals for this course are as follows:
- [ ] Learn modern software engineering practices such as agile development patterns, CI/CD, and quality-focused code development
- [ ] Practice my soft skills (communication, organiztion, etc.) during the project
- [ ] Pick up front-end development through HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- [ ] Become good friends with my teammates ðŸ™‚
